# Kermit Detection - Similiarty Modelling 1/2 Project

![Kermit Wanted Header](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/muppet/images/0/05/Iflorist_1.jpg)

This repository contains code for dececting Kermit the frog from 
`The Muppets TV Show` using visual and accoustic features made as part
of the `188.498 Similarity Modeling 2 - Computational Seeing and Hearing`
lecture at the Technical University of Vienna.
